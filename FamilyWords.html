To have raised five good hearted children in a cruel world, and to persevere through her own health problems and still stand tall with a can do attitude is what I admire the most about her. She never gives up, even when it seems the Universe is against her. My Mom makes her own destiny by overcoming obstacles that would break most people, smiling through the process and carrying those weaker on her shoulders. I love my Mom, She is my Hero and I would fight the whole world for her, even though I am fairly certain she could take on at least four Demigods and a rough 2-4 Legions of Demons.</p>
