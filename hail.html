              </p>
             <p>
                 I would like to make a “Shout Out” to my wonderful daughter. She is a terrific individual who loves to learn and excel at whatever interest takes her fancy. Whether that is studying herbal medicine, taking on line courses or investigating ancestral connections, she does it with enthusiasm and great attention to detail. A working Mom at home and in retail she still has time to take care of five kids and give them lots and lots of love. She still has amazing things to do on her journey of life and she is loved very, very much...Her Dad!
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 I am the mother of a very strong, loving, beautiful daughter.  I have always been very proud of what Brynn has accomplished.  Your life has not been an easy one at times, but you have always been there for your family.   The smiles that you put on peoples faces is a gift.  You have accomplished things that so many people, including myself, would say WOW.  Remember to never give up on your dreams.  I wish you all a wonderful YULE and know that I love and miss you all so very much.  Keep fighting Brynn but remember that you are not now nor will you ever be alone.
